facter (1.5.6-3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Micah Anderson ]
  * Switch the Depends priority from 'host | bind9-host' as the
    'host' package is really old and may be removed soon from the

facter (1.5.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added depends possibility on libopenssl-ruby1.9
  * Switch from install.rb to using the standardized Debian ruby CDBS
    classes to use setup.rb. This stops the munging of the shebang
    to a specific ruby version, as facter works with both 1.8 and 1.9
  * Install facter library dependencies in ruby version neutral
    directory: /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby
  * Add depends on libsetup-ruby1.8, ruby-pkg-tools and cdbs
